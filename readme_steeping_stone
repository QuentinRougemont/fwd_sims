very simplistic stepping stone models made of 4 populations.

* goal: test pop differentiation accross different MAF value for very simple set of demography
4 models:

*model.A: 4pop models where each pop are connect by same rate of migration (m = 0.01); each pop have a size of 10,000 individuals and will be maintained for 50K generations.
*model.B: 4pop models where each pop are connect by same rate of migration (m = 0.01); each pop have a size of 10,000 individuals and will be maintained for 50K generations.
*model.C: same as A but reduced migration rate between pop2 and pop3 due to a barrier to gene-flow for instance this can be a river or a montain separating two pop. or a change in oceanic current
*model.D: same as B but reduced migration rate between pop2 and pop3 due to a barrier to gene-flow for instance this can be a river or a montain separating two pop. or a change in oceanic current
